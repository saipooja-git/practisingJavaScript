Events
Events are actions or occurrences recognized by software that may be handled by the software. In the context of web development, events are usually associated with the Document Object Model (DOM) and can be tied to elements like buttons, forms, and windows. When an event occurs, it can trigger a function or a piece of code to execute, known as an event handler.
