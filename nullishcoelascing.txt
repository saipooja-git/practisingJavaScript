?? --> this is the symbol for nullishcoalscing 
nullish values are undefined and null, means 0 and '' are considered to be true.
for example,
restaurant.numGuests = 0;
const guests = restaurant.numGuests || 10; // output is 10
const guests2 = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10; // 0  -->here 0 is true in case of nullish so it printed true value as 0.

if we donst assign restaurant.numGuests to anything then,
const guests2 = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10; // 10 ---> here restaurant.numGuests is undefined,
so nullish considers it as false so it printed 10.
